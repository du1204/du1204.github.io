I am a Ph.D. candidate advised by Prof. [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/) in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University (SNU).
My major research topics are homomorphic encryption and lattice-based cryptography, but I am broadly interested in all aspects of cryptography and mathematical problems derived from them. 

I received my Bachelor's degree with Highest Honors from Mathematical Sciences at SNU in 2015.


## News and Upcoming Events

- My SNU team was chosen as one of the winners of Track 2 in [iDASH 2019](http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2019/) competition.

- The paper [[CKK+19]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/417.pdf) about "homomorphic comparison" was accepted to [ASIACRYPT 2019](https://asiacrypt.iacr.org/2019/) with an honor of being invited to [Journal of Cryptology](https://www.iacr.org/jofc/). (Top 3 of 71 accepted papers among 306 submissions)

- The paper [[CKP19]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/465.pdf) about "privacy-preserving cluster analysis based on homomorphic encryption" was accepted to [SAC 2019](https://uwaterloo.ca/selected-areas-in-cryptography/).


- I will be offline during 2019/10/10 ~ 2019/11/07 due to the alternative military service.
