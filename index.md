I am a Ph.D. candidate advised by Prof. [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/) in [Seoul National University](http://en.snu.ac.kr/).
My major research topics are Homomorphic Encryption and Lattice-based Cryptography, but I am broadly interested in all aspects of cryptography and mathematical problems derived from them.
