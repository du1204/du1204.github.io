I am a Ph.D. candidate advised by Prof. [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/) in Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University (SNU).
My major research topics are homomorphic encryption and lattice-based cryptography, but I am broadly interested in all aspects of cryptography and mathematical problems derived from them. 

I received my Bachelor's degree with Highest Honors from Mathematical Sciences at SNU in 2015.
