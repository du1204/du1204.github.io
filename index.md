I am a research scientist in Privacy Technologies Research Group at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html), Hillsboro.
My major research topics are homomorphic encryption and lattice-based cryptography, but I am broadly interested in all aspects of cryptography and mathematical problems derived from them. 

I completed my PhD in 2021 at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html) (SNU), where I was advised by [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/). In 2015, I graduated with Highest Honors from SNU where I majored in Mathematical Sciences.


## News and Upcoming Events

- My PhD Thesis entitled "[Machine Learning on Encrypted Data and Homomorphic Comparison](https://dcollection.snu.ac.kr/srch/srchDetail/000000163766?localeParam=en)" received the Best PhD Dissertation Award from the College of Natural Sciences at SNU.

- The paper [[CKK20]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1234.pdf) about “complexity-optimal homomorphic comparison” was accepted to [ASIACRYPT 2020](https://asiacrypt.iacr.org/2020/).

- The paper [[CKK+19]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/417.pdf) was selected for the Excellence Award at Samsung DS Industry-Academy Cooperation Project.

- The paper [[KSK+20]](https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12920-020-0722-1#citeas) about "HE-based semi-parallel GWAS computation" was accepted to [BMC Medical Genomics](https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/).
