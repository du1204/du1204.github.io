I am a Ph.D. candidate advised by Prof. [Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/) in Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University (SNU).
My major research topics are homomorphic encryption and lattice-based cryptography, but I am broadly interested in all aspects of cryptography and mathematical problems derived from them. 

I received my Bachelor's degree with Highest Honors from Mathematical Sciences at SNU in 2015.


## News and Upcoming Events

  1. The [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/417.pdf) about "homomorphic comparison" was accepted to ASIACRYPT 2019.
  2. I will be offline during 10/10/2019 ~ 7/11/2019 due to the alternative military service.
